
Print out 21 characters between ascii 33 and ascii 53

The byte array is defined with pointer aP

The P definition accesses each array member in turn and indexes into the font table that starts at $E000
It gets the first row of the character and works out what is blackand white pixel.  We are restricting the character to 5 pixels plus 1 space wide hence the 5 

The X definition selects and prints the nth member of the array aP

The Y definition works through each row in turn of the 8 bytes that form each character.
